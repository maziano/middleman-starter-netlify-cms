  This Premium DTF water-based high-density pigment ink is suitable for DTF
  printing and heat transfer. This ink will produce vivid colours with
  outstanding durability and washability. Can be used in Epson printers
  (modified for DTF) as well as all kinds of DTG machines. Our inks are
  specially formulated to reduce print head clogging and drying thus prolonging
  printer life during large production runs. We recommend that  you shake your
  ink  at least once a day or at the beginning of each use to avoid pigment
  splitting especially for white ink.
